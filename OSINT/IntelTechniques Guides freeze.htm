<h4 class="card-title">Credit Opt-Out</h4>
<hr>
<p class="card-text">
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the consumer credit 
reporting companies are permitted to include your name on lists used by 
creditors or insurers to make firm offers of credit or insurance that 
are not initiated by you. These are the pre-approved credit and 
insurance offers that you receive in the mail. They are often physically
 stolen by street criminals and submitted to receive a credit card in 
your name at their address. The FCRA also provides you the right to 
opt-out, which prevents consumer credit reporting companies from 
providing your credit file information to businesses. Through the 
website <a href="https://optoutprescreen.com/" target="_blank"> optoutprescreen.com</a>,
 you may request to opt-out from receiving such offers for five years. 
If you want to opt-out permanently, you can print a form that you must 
send through postal mail. If you choose to opt-out, you will no longer 
be included in offer lists provided by consumer credit reporting 
companies.</p>

<h4 class="card-title">Credit Freeze Submission</h4>
<hr>
<p class="card-text">Now that credit reports and freezes are free due to
 a new federal law, which can be researched at 
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155, I feel it
 is time to execute credit freezes in all possible locations. First, 
submit a credit freeze at the three “major” credit bureaus via their 
online submission, telephone, or postal mail options displayed within 
the following resources. I typically recommend clients begin with the 
online submission process and move to telephone or postal mail 
applications if anything is declined (which is common).<br><br>

Freezing your credit within these three bureaus will stop 90% of 
fraudulent identity takeover, but we can do better. The following were 
previously explained when we requested credit reports from the “minor” 
providers. The following steps allow you to freeze your credit profiles

<h4 class="card-title">Fraud Alerts</h4>
<hr>
<p class="card-text">In the previous edition of this guide, I only 
placed emphasis on the credit freeze, and did not explain a credit fraud
 alert. This was intentional, as a freeze is much more powerful than an 
alert. A freeze prohibits a hard credit check while an alert simply asks
 a creditor to dig deeper into any requests. In other words, a freeze 
stops unauthorized credit pulls while a fraud alert slows them down. In 
2020, I began recommending both credit freezes and fraud alerts if you 
want true protection from unauthorized credit accounts. This is because 
credit bureaus are slowly removing some of the protections of the credit
 freeze due to widespread adoption and the elimination of fees. 
Basically, people are freezing their credit in record numbers, which is 
causing headaches to the credit industry.<br><br>
All three major credit bureaus offer fraud alerts without any charge. 
However, choosing the best option is not always clear. Each bureau 
offers an initial 1-year alert, extended 7-year alert, or 1-year active 
duty military alert. My preference is always the extended 7-year option,
 but there are requirements to qualify. In order to obtain the 7-year 
protection, you must be the victim of “fraud” and must submit proof of 
this claim. Traditionally, this would be a police report of identity 
theft. However, I am aware of many people who cited various popular data
 breaches and submitted letters of notification from the breached 
companies. If you possess a police report of identity theft, this is 
always preferred. If not, I believe you should attempt a fraud alert by 
providing whatever documentation you have which supports fraud potential
 toward your credit. Once you have identified the documentation you will
 be sending, navigate to the following websites and select the 7-year 
extended fraud alert.<br><br>
https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-fraud-alerts/<br>
https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html<br>
https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts<br><br>
Follow the directions for each provider and wait for a mailed letter 
confirming activation of the alerts. Any time you seek a new line of 
credit, the credit bureau will apply more scrutiny toward your 
application, regardless of releasing a credit freeze. <br><br>
I now believe that a credit freeze + fraud alert combination is the most
 protective solution in regard to preventing unauthorized access to your
 credit report. The freeze prevents a hard pull on your credit, but it 
can be defeated by a determined adversary. The fraud alert adds 
additional layers and should demand a phone call to a predetermined 
number. Possessing both should deter a common criminal looking for an 
easy score.
